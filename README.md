# Front-End Web Development
## JavaScript
- Internet’s favorite programming language.
- Most popular scripting language and works on all major browsers.
- Scripting language is a lightweight programming language but very powerful.
- It was designed to add interactivity to web pages.
- Except for certain specialized libraries, JavaScript occurs entirely on the client, and not the server.
- JavaScript has nothing to do with Java.

## JavaScript’s Three Tiers of Awesome!!!
1. Comes with pre-built “magic” words.
2. Let you make your own “magic” words (functions).
3. There are libraries of “magic” words that others have built that you can use. (e.g. jQuery)

## Client-side JavaScript
- JavaScript can be run from 3 different points: inline, internal and external.
- Inline – is insert a snippet of JavaScript code into HTML code for execute immediately when it is encountered.
- Internal – provides a section within the header of the html file where declarations and functions are called within the html file itself.
- External – provides a separate file that contains all JavaScript functions and declarations and is referred to by the HTML file through a reference link.
